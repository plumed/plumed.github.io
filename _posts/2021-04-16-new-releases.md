it is a pleasure to announce three new PLUMED releases.

Release 2.7.1 is a maintenance release on the 2.7.x branch and includes updated GROMACS patches.

Release 2.6.3 is a maintenance release on the 2.6.x branch.

Release 2.5.7 is the last maintenance release on the 2.5.x branch.

They all solve minor bugs (see [changes for 2.5.7 here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-5.html)).

You can find all releases in the [download section](https://www.plumed.org/download) of the PLUMED webpage. They are also [tagged on github](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/tags).
