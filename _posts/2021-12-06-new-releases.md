It is a pleasure to announce three new PLUMED releases:

- release 2.7.3 is a maintenance release on the 2.7.x branch and solves a few bugs (see [ChangeLog](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-7.html));

- release 2.6.5 is a maintenance release on the 2.6.x branch and solves a few bugs (see [ChangeLog](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-6.html));

- release 2.8b is a brand new release that contains many new features (see [ChangeLog](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.8/user-doc/html/_c_h_a_n_g_e_s-2-8.html)). This release is still in beta, but we invite users to try it and provide feedback.

You can find all releases in the [download section](https://www.plumed.org/download) of the PLUMED webpage. They are also tagged on [GitHub](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/tags). [Conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/plumed) and [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/plumed/) packages are already up to date with version 2.7.3.
