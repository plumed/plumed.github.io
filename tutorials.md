PLUMED-TUTORIALS is a living textbook that teaches students about the research done by the members of the PLUMED consortium.
  All members can upload tutorials that explain how methods that they have developed can be used.  Members
  retain control over the lessons they contribute so they can easily keep the content updated. The PLUMED-TUTORIALS website monitors the
  compatibility of any PLUMED input files within these lessons with the current and development versions of the code and integrates links
  from these files to the PLUMED manual.  The lessons in the PLUMED-TUTORIALS thus provide a rich set of learning resources that students can
  employ when they first learn to use PLUMED.
