What is PLUMED?
-----------------------------

PLUMED is an open-source, community-developed library that provides a wide range of different methods, which include:

* enhanced-sampling algorithms
* free-energy methods
* tools to analyze the vast amounts of data produced by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

These techniques can be used in combination with a large toolbox of collective variables that describe complex processes in physics, chemistry, material science, and biology. 

PLUMED works together with some of the most popular MD engines, such as [ACEMD](https://www.acellera.com/products/molecular-dynamics-software-gpu-acemd/), [Amber](http://ambermd.org), [DL_POLY](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY.aspx), [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org), [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), [OpenMM](http://openmm.org), [DFTB+](https://www.dftbplus.org), [ABIN](https://github.com/PHOTOX/ABIN), [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org), [i-PI](http://ipi-code.org), [PINY-MD](https://github.com/TuckermanGroup/PINY), and [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org). In addition, PLUMED can be used to augment the capabilities of analysis tools such as [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), [HTMD](https://www.htmd.org), [OpenPathSampling](http://openpathsampling.org/latest/), and as a standalone utility to analyze pre-calculated MD trajectories.

PLUMED can be interfaced with the host code using a single well-documented API that enables the PLUMED functionalities to be imported. The API is accessible from multiple languages (C, C++, FORTRAN, and Python), and is thus compatible with the majority of the codes used in the community. The PLUMED license ([L-GPL](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html)) also allows it to be interfaced with proprietary software.
