PLUMED Masterclass
------------------

PLUMED Masterclass is a series of virtual and interactive classes, each one
focused on a specific theme ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics in molecular simulations.
Each class is composed by two lectures held on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): 
* Lecture I: an overview of the methodological background followed by a brief description of the exercises assigned to the students;
* Lecture II: a practical lecture in which the instructor solves the assigned exercises.

In between the two lectures, the participants will have one week to complete the exercises on their own or in groups.
They will have access to a dedicated [Slack](https://slack.com/) organization, where they will be able to
interact with lecturers and with other participants during the entire week.

__List of Classes__

Classes of the current edition (2022) are listed in chronological order at the beginning of the table. Classes of previous
editions can be found at the end of the table.

{:#browse-table .display}
| ord | ID | Topic | Lecture <br /> I | Lecture <br /> II | Instructors |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
{% for item in site.data.masterclass %}| {{ item.ord }} | {{ item.id }} | [{{ item.topic }}]({{ item.web }}) | [{{ item.date-I }}]({{ item.video-I }}) | [{{ item.date-II }}]({{ item.video-II }}) | [{{ item.instructor }}]({{ item.web-i }}) {% if item.instructor-II %} <br /> [{{ item.instructor-II }}]({{ item.web-i-II }}) {% endif %} |
{% endfor %}

By clicking on the **Topic** of each class, you will be redirected to the material used in the corresponding class.
By clicking on **Lecture I** or **Lecture II**, you will be redirected to the live recording of the lecture on YouTube.

__Practical info__

All lectures will take place at **3PM** London / **4PM** Paris time. The first lecture of each class will last approximately 1 hour, whereas the correction should last about 2 hours.
The classes of the second series will be delivered by PLUMED contributors. An introduction to the second series by Max Bonomi and Giovanni Bussi will be posted on YouTube on January 17.

__Poster session__

At the end of each series of lectures, all participants will be invited to a virtual poster session.

__Live vs recorded classes__

All lectures will be recorded and promptly made available for those who could not attend the live classes.
Participants to the live lectures will have the advantage of:
* interacting with the instructors and the other participants on Zoom during the lectures and on Slack during the week between two consecutive lectures;
* attending/presenting their work at the final poster session.

__Resources__

Participants are expected to run the exercises using their computing resources. For most of the classes,
a laptop with Linux or MacOS will be sufficient. However, for some classes access to a reasonable workstation will be required.
The required software will be provided on a [conda channel](https://anaconda.org/plumed).
At [this page](https://github.com/plumed/masterclass-2022) you can find instructions explaining how to install the basic software needed for most masterclasses.

__Participation__

For the 2022 series, we do not plan any sign-up procedure. All participants that are online when **Lecture I** starts will be admitted to the Zoom meeting. They will then receive the invitation for the Slack channel and for **Lecture II**. Masterclasses are independent of each other, so that you will be able to pick those that you are interested in. The Slack workspace contains a separate private channel for each masterclass (e.g. masterclass-22-1 will be the channel hosting the first masterclass of the 2022 series). If this is not your first masterclass, your user will be added to the relevant channel and you will be notified directly on Slack. More technical information will be made available later.
