PLUMED official website (www.plumed.org) - restyling 2019

Here are some notes for updating the website:

<!--
### Adding News
To add a news, just create a new .md file in the _posts directory named YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-the-post.md
with the content of the news. No title needs to be specified in the file as it is taken automatically from
the filename. Alternatively, you can add a header like this one to the md file:

````
---

title: A brand new www.plumed.org

layout: default

---
````
which can be useful in the future to add categories and tags to the post
--->

### Adding Releases
Just update the [_data/releases.yml](_data/releases.yml) file. In all places where version numbers are used (currently: the download section, the doc section, and the download button in the header) Jekyll variables are used in order to implement the correct links and texts.
